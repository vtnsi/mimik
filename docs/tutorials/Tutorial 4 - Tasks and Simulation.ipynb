    "\n",
    "The task is an attribute of each node in the component graph.  MIMIK provides an abstract Task class.  Each task will need to be created by the user.  The *forward* method in the Task class returns a probability of success. The user must create a function to produce the probability of success, which can be an estimated value (e.g., the probability of finding a target is 0.90 or 90%), a probability randomly sampled from a distribution such as a Normal distribution of past performance, or a custom function provided by the user. The Task classes are required to be in the *tasks* directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *tasks* directory is used by MIMIK to create a TaskFactory which searches for classes inheriting the *AbstractTask* class of MIMIK. Example classes used in this tutorial are provided in the docs/tutorials/tasks directory. There are two key things to note about creating a custom task. The first is that the task class must inherit from *AbstractClass* as previously mentioned. The second is that the task must include a *forward()* function which returns the probability the task succeeds. Any number of helper functions, classes, or libraries can be used to calculate the probability of a task, and more advanced examples can be found in the *examples* directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task associated with each component is defined in the JSON configs file as an attribute of the component.  The attribute contains the name of each Task and the arguments for each task.  The JSON for this tutorial is displayed below. The only task argument for this simple tutorial is the probability of success for each task."
