    "# Understanding Killwebs\n",
    "\n",
    "A killweb is best understood as a series of interconnected systems and components which work together to complete a mission. This concept is the evolution of the kill chain which is a single, linear path of connected components that are used to complete each task within a given mission. Killwebs aim to enhance mission planning by striving for joint capabilities that are more robust than a kill chain could offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say a given mission has a multitude of sensors and weaponry available for use. Any given kill chain would only consider a single sensor, weapon pair that could be used to complete the mission. On the other hand, a killweb simultaneously models and visualizes all components, systems, and their interactions to analyze a given mission and its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider two ways of modeling and visualizing killwebs: at the component level and at the system level. We will begin by discussing the component level analysis, followed by a discussion at the system level. Although it is possible to apply these concepts to other mission frameworks or scenarios, the remainder of this notebook will be specific to the exemplar."

    "# Exemplar 1: Long Range Strikes\n",
    "\n",
    "The mission you are tasked with involves striking a moving target from a long distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that there are many different ways of mission decomposition into multiple tasks. Different branches, organizations, or teams might use their own methods for the tasks required to complete a mission. We will focus on the F2T2EA decomposition framework. An acronym for Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, Assess, this represents the necessary tasks needed to complete a mission. This mission decomposition was chosen for its simplicity and popularity, but this research can be applied to any task-based mission decomposition. Now we have the mission goal and the means to decompose the mission into a series of manageable tasks. In creating your own example, this would be a good time to fulfill the first two requirements of creating a config file and populating a tasks directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this mission decomposition framework in mind, we have to:\n",
    "1. Find - Identify the target to be struck. Successful completion of this task identifies the target to be a mobile anti-aircraft missile launcher.\n",
    "2. Fix - Determine the target's location. Successful completion of this task provides the exact coordinates of the anti-aircraft launcher.\n",
    "3. Track - Continuously monitor the target's movement. This step is continuous and its success ensures the anti-aircraft launcher's location remains up to date.\n",
    "4. Target - Select the device that will be used to strike the anti-aircraft launcher. Taking into account all parameters, success here will provide the weapon used for the strike.\n",
    "5. Engage - Send the selected weapon in to strike the anti-aircraft launcher.\n",
    "6. Assess - Evaluate the results of the strike by determining whether or not the anti-aircraft launcher was destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a collection of components and systems, we can begin by creating the killwebs before analyzing it for any valuable data."
