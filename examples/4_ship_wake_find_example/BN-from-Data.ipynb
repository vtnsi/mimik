However, we don't want to make such a strong inference -- can we really say the outcome will always be 100% true from a single test? The following cell stores parameters for a simple uniform prior. Additional information on priors can be learned [from the pgmpy documentation](https://pgmpy.org/detailed_notebooks/10.%20Learning%20Bayesian%20Networks%20from%20Data.html#Bayesian-Parameter-Estimation), which is how we implement the BN. \n",
