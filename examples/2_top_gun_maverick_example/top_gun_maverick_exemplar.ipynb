The radar is compatible with each of the first pair of Daggers' targeting system, the first missles all lead to each of the latter pairs' targeting system, and the second pair of missles conclude the mission. At a first glance, this killweb seems relatively robust. There is a lot of compatibility throughout the web, but further analysis shows a different story."
